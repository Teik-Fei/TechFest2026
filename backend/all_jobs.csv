"Consulting, Cyber Operational Technology, Graduate Associate 2026",KPMG,Singapore,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Competitive,Not Applicable,"Job Description  At KPMG, your long-term future is every bit as important to us as it is to you. That's why our aim is to give you experiences that will stay with you for a lifetime. Whether it's great training and development, working across functional sectors, mobility opportunities or corporate responsibility volunteering activities - you'll gain a wealth of experiences on which to build a rewarding career. We're proud of our culture - it's one that recognises hard work, encourages new ways of thinking and embraces diversity and inclusion. We have an innovative spirit which inspires what we do and how we do it - striving to be better lies at the heart of who we are.  Technology underpins many of the most influential organisations in the world and presents opportunities for businesses that want to seek out new markets and are prepared to invest in transformational change. The last ten years have seen a rapid emergence of new technology, greater connectivity for organisations and individuals, and a 24/7 approach to global commerce. However, this has left many organisations behind the curve and struggling to achieve their business aspirations without feeling exposed to risks. We believe that by turning traditional thinking on its head, adopting a positive approach to managing risk, will set organisations free to achieve their business aspirations.  KPMG Cybersecurity professionals assist clients to address their concerns around Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Privacy of their technology, business systems, and information assets. Using a holistic view of how Technology and Business integrate, the Cyber team performs technology-risk focused assessments, technology compliance, IT/operational process reviews, and design of information risk & cyber security solutions.   We are looking for candidates to join a growing team to assist clients in the following area:  Cybersecurity in Operational Technology (OT) is a challenging but fulfilling field. One challenging aspect of this field is that it sits in intersection of two disciplines that usually do not intersect. Cybersecurity has its origins in Information Technology (IT), while OT system and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are used by engineers to control and monitor physical processes. Professionals with expertise in both disciplines are rare.

On Hypotenuse AI, brands can store their product data, and have AI agents fill in missing details, edit their product images and write their content. Hypotenuse AI is impacting the entire ecommerce industry globally, with customers ranging from brands like Billabong and Crunchyroll to some of the largest department stores in US and Canada. We’re backed by top global investors like Y Combinator, January Capital and executives from Amazon, Shopback and other VCs/angels, and have an experienced team of hard-hitters with a background in AI research, ecommerce and top startups. Join us if you want to be part of the journey as we build a generational company reshaping AI & ecommerce! The role We’re looking for an experienced full stack engineer to join us as we scale and reshape how ecommerce brands work. We handle large amounts of data (millions of product records per customer), across many brands, and are constantly onboarding new customers fast—scaling up what we do is a key priority in this role. We don’t want code monkeys. In this role, you’ll be extremely hands on, spending the bulk of time rapidly building features, fixes and improvements, while working on a high level: scaling infra, architecting/designing new components and thinking about the product. Here are some examples of the types of problems that teammates in this role work on: designing and implementing a new image generation workflow and feature from start to end orchestrating and engineering context around AI models/LLMs to maximize performance (output quality, speed and reliability) optimizing database queries or frontend components to reduce generation time from X to Y rapidly shipping and iterating on new and core features scaling up our infrastructure to be able to handle high concurrency, high volume asynchronous jobs so it can handle a load of X in Y time influencing our current engineering practices and constantly improving them to increase dev speed, reduce bugs, improve code practices etc. You’ll work on features and applications that push the frontier of what’s possible today, setting the groundwork and solving problems from first principles to reshape how ecommerce brands work as an industry. To achieve that level of impact, we work intensely and move fast. Expect new features every few days. Expect hard work, long hours. Expect to build things that no one has done before. We thrive on speed and precision, coupled with a whole lot of new technology. Sound like you? We want engineers who can thrive in a startup; able to work in an extremely fast-paced environment, and can truly drive building features from scratch. We’re looking for engineers who: Own things end-to-end: we’re a startup. You aren’t here to just receive instructions. We want you to be a thinker and driver. Play a part in figuring out the features to build, the architecting of it, and driving it all the way to customer impact. Obsess over problems: if you love to dig deep into architecture and scaling issues, optimize queries, figuring out tricky bugs; if you obsess and have a constant curiosity to dig deep and learn, then we are your tribe. Are product minded: you think beyond just code. You understand the customer, problem statements, and are able to drive impact on a product-level. Bonus if you love interacting directly with users. Not all of the following are strict requirements, but experience and a strong foundation will help a long way: You've designed and built backend architectures (i.e. experience with AWS, designing APIs, components, database optimizations etc..), often needing to handle large amounts of data and concurrent or asynchronous jobs You're familiar with software engineering best practices (testing, logging/monitoring, deployments, event tracking etc..) and have worked with large codebases before Interest in AI (experience in AI and training AI models isn’t a requirement—you’ll learn a lot about that from our team here, but it is a bonus, and you need to have a strong interest and inclination for it) We're hiring across all experience levels — from fresh graduates to junior, senior, and lead software engineers.

As a Software Engineer Intern, you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Foundry, or Palantir Apollo: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organisation is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product.
