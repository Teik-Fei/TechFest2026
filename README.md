## Inspiration

Singapore’s job seekers face a frustrating reality.

Despite taking courses, earning certifications, and polishing resumes, many still struggle to land interviews.

We noticed three recurring problems:

- People don’t know what skills employers actually value  
- Learning platforms feel disconnected from real job outcomes  
- Resumes get filtered out by AI systems due to poor keyword matching  

Existing job portals only show listings.  
They don’t guide people on **what to learn, how to improve, or how to position themselves**.

We wanted to build something different.

Not just a job board, but a **career companion**.

## What it does

jobscope transforms fragmented career information into a **personalised, step-by-step roadmap** toward employment.

Users simply:
1. Select their dream role
2. Upload their resume
3. Receive tailored recommendations

The platform then:

-  Matches users to jobs with compatibility scores  
-  Analyses resumes intelligently (skills + experience + gaps)  
-  Recommends targeted courses, certifications, and projects  
-  Suggests concrete upskilling actions  
-  Provides industry insights and career pathways  

Instead of guessing what to learn next, users get **clear direction**.

## How we built it

We designed jobscope as a full-stack AI-powered web platform.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express (API services)
- **Database:** mySQL 
- **AI/NLP:** Resume parsing, skill extraction, semantic matching
- **Matching Engine:** Role–skill similarity scoring

### System Flow
1. Resume uploaded → NLP parsing
2. Skills + experience extracted
3. Compared against job requirement database
4. Skill gaps identified
5. Personalised roadmap generated
6. Curated resources recommended

This creates a seamless pipeline from **profile → analysis → action plan**.

## Challenges we ran into

### Resume parsing accuracy
Resumes come in messy formats (PDFs, different styles, inconsistent wording).  
Extracting clean, structured skill data was tougher than expected.

###  Skill matching logic
Simple keyword matching wasn’t enough.  
We had to design smarter similarity scoring to handle:
- synonyms
- related tools
- transferable skills

###  Avoiding generic advice
We wanted true personalisation, not “take random courses”.  
Balancing specificity with scalability was challenging.

###  Integrating multiple data sources
Jobs, courses, and career insights had to be unified into one smooth experience.

### Connecting back-end and front-end together
With some of us lacking coding background, having to work together and linking multitudes of codes together proves to be very tough for all of us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

 Built a working end-to-end prototype  
 Automated resume → skill gap → roadmap generation  
 Created meaningful compatibility scores for job matching  
 Designed a clean, beginner-friendly UX  
 Turned a complex career problem into a simple guided journey  

Most importantly, we built something we’d **actually use ourselves** as students and fresh grads.
Something that is useful, all-in-one and without hassle.

## What we learned

This project taught us that:

- Career development is a **data problem**, not just a listing problem  
- Personalisation matters more than volume  
- AI should guide decisions, not overwhelm users  
- Users want clarity and actionable steps, not information overload  

We also gained hands-on experience with:
- NLP
- recommender systems
- full-stack integration
- product design thinking
